This is a trial project created for hands on try, based on the article by ***Marcella Maki*** on       
## [Object Relationships in Basic Ruby](https://medium.com/@marcellamaki/object-relationships-in-basic-ruby-1af5773fff48)    


## Ruby-Version-2.7.2

Check the `master` branch. The `Classes` folder holds the `Cinema` and `Movie` classes   
If you would like to get **pry-byebug** console bundle first.  
`bundle`     

And run script file          
`ruby script.rb` and you will get the pry console,     

try `next` and you can check objects created/modified on each line of execution by entering the object variable name into the pry console    
For for more pry console commands [Check Pry Commands](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/pry-byebug)   
   
If you just need to run the output objects try running the script commenting the line `binding.pry`
